# red

Rust text EDitor.

To run on MacOS:

```bash
$ export LIBRARY_PATH="$LIBRARY_PATH:$(brew --prefix)/lib"
$ cargo run
```

Demo (looks laggy because GIFs...):

![red demo video](./red_demo.gif)

There's a `red_demo.mov` in the repository if you want better quality, or else just compile and run the project.

I'm working on a OpenGL branch which will eventually use FreeType, that'll make text rendering more professional ðŸ˜‰.
